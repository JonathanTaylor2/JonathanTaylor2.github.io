Nissan was the No. 1 forklift retailer in the world last year, earning $8.562 billion through their materials handling division.

YaleÂ® trucks are manufactured in an ISO 9001:2008 registered facility and range in capacity from 2,000 to 36,000 lbs.</p>
<p>3300-4500 mm Duplex or Triplex clear-view mast options available, to give you flexibility in customising your forklift for the job at hand. Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
<h2>Industrial Lift Truck & Equipment Fairview </h2>

<p>We have tons of lifted Chevy trucks, lifted Dodge trucks, lifted GMC trucks, lifted Jeeps, lifted SUVs, and more. Additionally, regular maintenance is necessary for gas forklifts to prevent breakdowns. Counterbalance forklifts are available in 4-wheel and 3-wheel configuration.

<p>Although forklifts are fairly easy machines to operate, it is recommended that all drivers receive proper forklift training and certification. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 pounds rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties.

They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
