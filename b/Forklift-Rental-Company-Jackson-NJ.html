<p>Suspension lifts are also found on a number of high performance sports cars, in which a very low ground clearance is used to improve handling, using an aerodynamic effect known as downforce; examples include the Ferrari 488, Lamborghini Huracan, McLaren 720S, and the second generation Ford GT. Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
<p>For others, it's the enhanced functionality and driver satisfaction that makes these trucks attractive choice.

Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck.
