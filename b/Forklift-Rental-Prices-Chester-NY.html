<p>Order picker forklifts enable operators to directly pick stock from aisles onto an empty pallet. A conveyor, overhead hoist, or equivalent material handling equipment shall be provided for handling batteries. Off-road forklifts are suitable for almost any environment (construction sites, docks, forests, etc.), they offer increased mobility and excellent results in areas where the terrain is rough. An unloaded forklift can also tip from the weight of the counterbalance, so safe driving is just ask important with an unloaded lift.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory. Reach truck - This one is a variant on a Rider Stacker forklift, designed for small aisles, usually Electrically Powered, named because the forks can extend to reach the load.</p>
