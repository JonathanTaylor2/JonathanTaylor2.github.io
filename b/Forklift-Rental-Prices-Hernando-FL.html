The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48‚Äù will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work. One major difference between a forklift and a car is stability. That's why we invest heavily in keeping our rental fleet in optimum condition. Watrana is today a pioneer brand for forklifts and spare parts in India.</p>
