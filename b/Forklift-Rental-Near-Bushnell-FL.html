The 44236 Series has two machines, with capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, offering lift heights up to 34 feet. These kinds of lift kits are popular because no work is necessary to adjust the suspension or other mechanical systems on the truck.

This Construction Plant Competence Scheme (CPCS) training course is aimed at those who operate a Rough Terrain Forklift in a construction environment and have successfully completed the CSCS Health, Safety and Environment touchscreen test for Operatives within the past two years.

Most rented forklifts include a full maintenance package that covers all consumables, repairs, etc. No matter what type of project, we'll find the forklift that's best suited to your needs.

Top-notch customer service and trustworthy equipment—that's why Atlas is one of the leading Toyota forklift dealers in the Chicago, IL area.

As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
