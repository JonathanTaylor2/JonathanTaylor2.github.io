Also known as a large capacity forklift, the industrial forklift is essential for a warehouse with heavier loads.

<p>At Thompson Machinery, we've invested in a fleet of Cat forklifts, so you don't have to. Simply let us know when you need your forklift and for how long. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see. Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages.</p>
