<p>Designed to increase productivity when handling heavy loads, the innovative and unique BT Pro Lifter model LHM230P requires up to 67% less force than a standard hand pallet truck to begin moving. Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>Usually they can reach heights up to 390″ Order pickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries. You can also use an electric forklift outdoors. Many lifted truck stores put lifts on high mile trucks, and this can lead to a poor ride and other issues that are associated with lifted vehicles.

Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust.
