Commonly found on port loading docks, scrap yards and recycling plants, and within an endless variety of other industrial applications, there is one consistency among every rough terrain forklift: versatility. Each is designed to work within extreme environments, natural landscapes, and the uneven ground often found on construction sites.</p>
<p>It would be a nightmare in New York City, but Nashville's spread out communities are made for vehicles like The Beast, and it fits right in if you drive an hour outside the city.
