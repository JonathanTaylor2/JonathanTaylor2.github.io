From a pallet jack to a telehandler, Lencrow Forklifts has Australia's largest and most comprehensive range of new, used and hire equipment. The lift helps going through or over tough terrain and is especially great for off-roading and mudding enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Scissor lifts provide access for people or equipment to height-restricted areas (up to 90'). Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. The pallet trucks may be manual or battery-powered. We ensure that we are affordable and always reliable, so you can always count on having the best experience when you service, buy or hire a forklift with us.</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48” will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work. One major difference between a forklift and a car is stability. That's why we invest heavily in keeping our rental fleet in optimum condition. Watrana is today a pioneer brand for forklifts and spare parts in India.</p>
