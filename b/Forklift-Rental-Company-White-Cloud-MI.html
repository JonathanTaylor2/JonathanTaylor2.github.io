<p>As long as the needs of your business fit the abilities and the strengths of the forklift, both the electric forklift and electric reach stacker can be extremely beneficial to your company. Suspension Lift Kit: If money's not an object and you want to go all out for a kit that lifts both your body and suspension for maximum off-road capabilities, a suspension lift kit is the way to go.</p>
<p>Rough Terrain Forklift Safety Training Matters. Test N5 - both reach and straddle trucks (except with tilting mast) - stability is usually obvious, in which case test may be waived. Browse our selection of lifted Ford, Chevy, and Dodge lifted trucks. Faster travel, lift and lower speeds reduce order picking time, the most labour intensive materials handling function.</p>

Wide range of equipment options for the operator's cab, such as storage trays and lighting. Forklifts also come in different sizes and models. We offer you high quality diesel forklift, rough terrain forklift and fork lift and make sure they meet your demand.</p>
<p>Order picking forklift truck means a forklift truck where the operator controls are incorporated with the lifting media and elevate with the lifting media. This heavy-duty multidirectional reach truck is AC driven with clear-view masts, 360° steering and sideways battery exchange for optimized productivity. For distributors who want to maximize their warehousing space through high density storage, a standup forklift offers significant advantages over a traditional sit-down truck.</p>
<p>A lifted truck, often referred to as a 4x4 truck, is a modified vehicle specially designed for off road driving and other types of high-impact work. At a minimum, you should have a card or certificate of proof of training and the vehicle load charts (and attachment load charts as well, if applicable) on the jobsite—OSHA will look for these items first.
