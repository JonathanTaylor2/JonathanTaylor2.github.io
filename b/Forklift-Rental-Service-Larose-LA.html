<p>Most RT forklifts available in the North American market use Tier 4-Final engines, and many of these engines are rated at 74 horsepower, such as the 4.4-liter JCB EcoMax engine used in the company's model 950 RT forklift. A person performing this work is required to hold an order picking forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence.

Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>
<p>Off-roading tests the limits of both your Jeep and you as a driver. There are extensive ranges of forklifts available which include pedestrian operated machines to heavy duty driver operated trucks.
