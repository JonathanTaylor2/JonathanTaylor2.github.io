With a complete range of rental plans to choose from, greater flexibility in handling operational peaks and troughs, and predictable costs, rentals can make both commercial and financial sense.

<p>A 4,000 lbs forklift with a 500 lbs clamp can only add 3,500 more lbs of items.

<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
