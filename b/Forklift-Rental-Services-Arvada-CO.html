<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

<p>Available in both manual and electric operated versions, pallet trucks come in different variants to suit desired applications. The load limit of the lift truck decreases as the load centre is raised. Your solution: a high-capacity electric forklift.

One of the most popular adjustments to trucks is the lift kit - moving the entire truck higher in the air by changing out suspension parts. About 92% of these are forklifts, 1% are material handling equipment parts. This purchasing guide will examine the specific features that qualify the machines to be considered 'rough terrain'.</p>
<p>To learn more about the EWRS-RTF series of jcb rough terrain forklift tires, give us a call or submit a quote request to speak with one of our product specialists. To refresh the skills and knowledge of participants in the safe operation of industrial counterbalance lift trucks. Keep in mind that body lifting can only raise vehicles from 1 to 3 inches total, which means you cannot get a huge lift from these kits.</p>
<p>Most counterbalanced forklifts have a three-point suspension system, meaning that the truck is supported at the two front wheels and the center of the steer axle. Roll Pallet Trucks are suitable for handling paper, textile, polymer, carpets and other rolls upto 2000 kgs.

<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
