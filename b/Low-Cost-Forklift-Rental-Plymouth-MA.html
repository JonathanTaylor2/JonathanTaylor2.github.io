<h2>New, Used, Or Rental Forklifts Plymouth </h2>
<p>This series includes lift trucks that can lift loads from 1 t to 8 t. The models are split into three categories, starting with the 1-3,5-t models. The next huge advance in the forklift industry involved the electric engine. Our annual look at the largest global manufacturers of lift trucks ranked by revenue. Skids were the first pallets ever produced, appearing in American factories along with low-lift trucks in the late 1880s.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust. From the moment you first step into the reception area, decorated with handmade up-cycled furniture built from old pallets to the large warehouse space where the forklifts, order pickers, boom, and scissor lifts all operate, we have made a huge effort for the whole place to be a positive, professional, clean, modern and friendly environment.</p>
