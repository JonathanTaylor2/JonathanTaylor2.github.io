An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load.

<p>Being trained to operate a forklift with an internal combustion engine and pneumatic tires, also known as a Class 5, that is commonly used in General Industry, only allows one to operate that specific class of lift truck. Please do not hesitate to give us a call, or send us an inquiry, and we'd be happy to help you find the right forklift for your business.</p>
<p>As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor. If your employer deems this certification to be sufficient enough to operate the forklift safely and properly, they will grant you a license. The top supplying country or region is China, which supply 100% of all terrain forklifts respectively.</p>
