In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144‚Äù you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation. We will conduct a learner analysis to identify the duration of training required for those with limited or no experience, whereas experienced operators can attend a one day Experienced Worker Assessment (Test Only).</p>

In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period.

When the operator is done with pallet jack, he or she shouldn't leave the equipment just sitting out anywhere.</p>
<p>We offer free equipment rental assessment surveys to determine what specifications match your project requirements.
