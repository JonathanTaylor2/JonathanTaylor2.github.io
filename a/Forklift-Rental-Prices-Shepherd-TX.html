Off-road forklifts are suitable for almost any environment (construction sites, docks, forests, etc.), they offer increased mobility and excellent results in areas where the terrain is rough.

<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses.

If you're working outdoors, a gas forklift may make sense, but the introduction of the electric forklift has fundamentally changed warehouse usage.</p>

Additionally Pengate rentals offer the following advantages: low rates (which include batteries and chargers); rental rates may be expensible for tax purposes; maintenance service by our Raymond Certified Technicians at no added charge; the ability to opt into a rent-to-own program.</p>
