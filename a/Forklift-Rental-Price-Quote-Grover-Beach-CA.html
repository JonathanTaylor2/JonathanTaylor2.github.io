By visiting your facility, our equipment specialists gain first-hand knowledge of your production, the product you move and challenges experienced by your forklift operators.

We've got forklifts reserved and maintained for rental customers, with everything from forklift hand pallet trucks, powered pallet truck forklifts and stacking forklifts through to 12 tonne forklifts and specialised very narrow aisle equipment.</p>
<p>You may also ask to view the forklift's service record or work orders. Figure out whether you want to stick close to Ohio or are up for a road trip, and then consider one of these great vacation spots to visit in your lifted Jeep.
