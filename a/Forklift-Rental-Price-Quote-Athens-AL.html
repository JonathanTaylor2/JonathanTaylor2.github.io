<p>Our range of products include Order Picker Forklift and Forklift Truck. Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. When you're looking to buy a forklift in Bristol, the first thing you should do is pick up the phone to us. It may well be that you already know exactly what you want, in which case we will provide you with a quote.</p>
<p>Our versatile Furniture Orderpickers enable you to equip your truck with the ideal fork length with extended baselegs for rail guidance application; select from varying fork lengths ranging from 42-96 inches. Generally, the forklift's wheels and frame are designed for a specific tire type, so check the forklift's manual before going with a different tire type than what is recommended.</p>

<p>In addition to forklifts, we rent forklift attachments, aerial lifts, pallet jacks, sweeper scrubbers, and utility vehicles. In a factory setting, the electric forklift can operate all day on a single charge. 2. 2 Disclaimer This presentation is intended as a resource for providing training on OSHA's revised powered industrial truck operator standards.

<h2>Clark Lift Trucks Athens</h2>

<p>Firstly, a different training course is required for each type of forklift you wish to operate. Rough terrain pallet jacks 5 are designed specifically for use on uneven ground. Order-pickers and drivers of powered high-lift trucks face a variety of hazards that require training on compliant standards and practices, truck operational procedures, working surfaces and conditions, as well as fall protection training.</p>

While the dealer insures the equipment, you'll want to make sure your company's insurance covers the operator, other people at your facility and the facility in the event of an injury or property damage when the rented forklift is in use.</p>
