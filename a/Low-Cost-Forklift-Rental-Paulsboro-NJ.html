<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. The forklift's AC system features precise speed control, quickly adapts to varying conditions, and varies output for continued, consistent operation. This is a person we would never invite to a party; a person whose lifted truck parked outside a restaurant we were considering would cause us to eat somewhere else. There are many good advantages of hiring material handling equipment.</p>

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

Regardless of the order picker or forklift job, one thing is for certain: if your employees drive order picker trucks, they need an order picker license.</p>

But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>
