PLS Kits are available for most of the popular vehicle applications and can be completely removed if necessary.

Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place.
