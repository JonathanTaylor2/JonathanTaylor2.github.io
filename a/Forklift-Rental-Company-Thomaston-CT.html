With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 30 feet in the air. Backed by our proven support network, Crown's internal combustion forklifts are ready to handle the tough assignments. Our exclusive lifted models make these professional-grade trucks even more impressive and capable.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift.

<p>Essentially, rough terrain forklifts are built to be durable. Today they have become ubiquitous on construction sites due to their ability to haul loads and then extend them out for delivery. Rough-terrain forklifts are ideal for construction sites because they can handle everything from loose dirt to finished flooring.
