A electric hand pallet truck is one of the most commonly used lift trucks in industrial companies. Should you operate forklift trucks you will be aware that all drivers need to be properly trained and certified.

A hydraulic hand pump is powered by manual movement and meant for projects requiring portability. The "HD" in name on many of these trucks stands for "heavy duty" which is expertly brought out in full force thanks to these lifts and customizations as well as their trim levels and available engines.</p>
