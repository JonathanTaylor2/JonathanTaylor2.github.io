From electric pallet jacks to narrow aisle lift trucks or sit-down rider forklifts, we'll help you find exactly what you need and get it to your facility when you need it. Any surface a forklift drives on must be able to support the forklift and its load with a safety factor of four. If you intend to go beyond a short-term rental, consider talking with your local MCFA lift truck dealer first to make sure you get the most out of your forklift rental.</p>
<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>
