<h2>Lift Trucks & Materials Handling Equipment Branford </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>
<p>Unlike most other companies in the equipment rental space, Herc Rentals offers a number of tools along with their tractors and forklifts. Our hand pallet truck steering wheels in Nylon and PU are available in the markets with the customization facilities to cater to the ever changing needs of clients. You can get a lifted truck at home with a lift kit, have it done professionally, or buy a truck that is already lifted.</p>
<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.‚Äù KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015. The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>

<h3>Forklift Truck Branford CT</h3>
<p>When you're buying a new forklift or pallet loader, you can discuss trading in your old material handling equipment with the sales professionals from Mid-Ohio Forklifts, Inc.
