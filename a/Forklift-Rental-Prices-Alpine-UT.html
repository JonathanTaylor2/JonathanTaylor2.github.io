<p>Canada and Mexico are the largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers, according to ITA. The growth of the region is due to the demand for modern material handling equipment across industries such as construction, mining, food, and beverage, etc. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>
<h2>Forklift Ignition Parts Fire Up Your Truck's Performance in Alpine </h2>
<p>Importantly, the electric pallet jack has been built with safety reverse button as well as the good quality steel. The four-wheel versions are Class 4 forklifts. The AUSA 3000-3500 kg forklifts are compact, have a high-performance hydrostatic transmission and are available in 2-wheel drive and 4x4 versions. Lift trucks use either gasoline-powered engines, diesel engines, or electric motors, with the power supplied by a rechargable industrial battery.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>There are also variants that features a stand-up forklift, which makes it easier for operators to hop on and off between loads. The user should mark, on the sides of the truck, in letters at least 1½ in. high, the actual vehicle weight, the maximum load and the combined weight of the vehicle and capacity load. The 35 Construction Teletruk counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver.</p>
<h2>Fork Truck Safety Alpine</h2>
<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>

Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
