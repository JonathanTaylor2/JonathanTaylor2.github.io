<h3>Forklift Information Toms River NJ</h3>
<p>Double Reach Trucks are commonly used in factory, food processing and general warehousing industries. Trying to lift loads too heavy for your forklift creates a great risk of a tip-over accident, this can also risk damaging product and plant facilities. A double mast forklift has a second mast attached to the carriage of the first mast. There's no better way to move equipment and materials around a factory or work site than with a forklift.</p>
<p>Our manoeuvrable and versatile EFG counterbalance forklift trucks are designed for maximum performance at minimum energy consumption: latest generation 3-phase AC motors, highest efficiency thanks to PureEnergy concept, productivity-enhancing ergonomics and optimum safety. In the material handling industry, the uses of the electric forklift and electric reach stacker are both steadily increasing.</p>

It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
