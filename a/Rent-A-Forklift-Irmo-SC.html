<h2>Lifting & Material Handling Irmo </h2>
<p>We manufacture, export, import and supply a wide range of equipment for Floor Transportation comprising of Electric Pallet Trucks, Scissor Hand Pallet Trucks, Hydraulic Hand Pallet Trucks and Electric Platform Trucks. Load Backrest Extension should have height, width, and size of openings (not to exceed 6 inches in one of the two dimensions) sufficient to minimize the possibility of the load from falling toward the mast when the mast is in a position of maximum rearward tilt.</p>
<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of styles and designs available, some capable of moving loads of 5000lbs, but the main difference is between the lift and pallet trucks.

Even if you've never walked into a warehouse or never even seen a forklift or order picker, our training caters to all types of skill levels. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.</p>

We supply only high quality, safe, reliable equipment and forklifts and will facilitate everything from selecting the right forklift, helping with finance arrangements, to a seamless delivery.</p>
<p>The majority of all rough terrain forklifts will have pneumatic tires since they are designed for traveling outdoors, such as on gravel or in yard work.
