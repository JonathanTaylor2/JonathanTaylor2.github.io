<p>This motor does the work of lifting the load and moving the hand truck. Powered High-Lift Trucks: Order-Picker Safety is a complete package that tends to all safety needs of order-pickers and drivers and will help keep your facility incident-free in its daily operational use of powered high-lift trucks. We carry models such as a lifted GMC Sierra or a black, lifted Ford F-150.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
