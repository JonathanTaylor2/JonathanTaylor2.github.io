With lift heights of up to 8.5 meters and load capacities from 1.2 to 3 tons, the Toyota 7FBRE series, 8FBRE series and BT Reflex series offers truck models suitable for block stacking, drive-in racking, and long load handling.</p>
<p>Also, aftermarket installations like a lift kit can void the warranty on a lot of vehicles - that's a lot of benefits to leave on the table. Establish a timeline of how long your rental will last. We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town. Pump trucks are primarily used as a pallet jack but do not use any electric power to lift any materials.</p>
