<p>Right now, drivers absolutely love vehicles capable of off-road driving. Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,” says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>A-brand forklift trucks are offered such as Kalmar, Hyster, Terex, SMV, Svetruck, Caterpillar, Linde, BT Toyota, TCM, Komatsu, Yale, Nissan, Mitsubishi and other brands. Programmed Skilled Workforce are currently seeking LO Order Picker Forklift Operators for one of our Major National clients located in Truganina.
